Quickstart Guide

for help type:
python main.py -h

To start a game with 4 random agents run the command:
python main.py

If you want to play as a human run:
python main.py -agents human random
(This will run one human and three randoms)

You can replace random with one of the following:
onemove, prob, monte, genetic or human (if you want more human players)

The default number of player is 4, but if you add -num_player 3 there will be 3 players.
