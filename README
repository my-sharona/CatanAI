Quickstart Guide

for help:
main.py -h

To start a game with 4 random agents:
main.py

If you want to play as a human run:
main.py -agents human random
(This will run one human and three randoms)

You can choose agents from any of the following:
random, onemove, prob, monte, genetic or human (if you want more human players)

The default number of players is 4, adding '-num_player 3' will change that to 3 players.
